Philippine Terrestrial Biodiversity,The Philippines is known for its rich biodiversity. Why do you think having a wide variety of plants and animals is important for the environment?,It makes the country look more colorful.,It ensures ecosystems can recover and adapt to changes.,It only benefits humans by providing food.,It prevents plants from growing too tall.,Option 2
Philippine Terrestrial Biodiversity,Imagine you’re a scientist studying mangrove forests in the Philippines. You notice that many areas have been lost over the years. How might this impact local ecosystems?,It will increase fish populations in those areas., It will decrease the natural protection against floods.,It will improve water quality for nearby towns.,It will make the soil more fertile.,Option 2
Philippine Terrestrial Biodiversity,The Haribon Foundation works to protect Philippine biodiversity. How can conservation efforts like theirs help endangered species?,By removing all predators from the ecosystem.,By promoting awareness and protecting habitats.,By planting non-native species in new areas.,By capturing wild animals to keep them as pets.,Option 2
Philippine Terrestrial Biodiversity,"The Philippines has several biogeographic zones, like Luzon and Mindanao, that are rich in unique species. How do you think these zones contribute to the country’s overall biodiversity?","They isolate species, leading to fewer varieties.",They allow unique species to evolve in different areas.,They limit the spread of plants and animals.,They prevent animals from adapting to their environment.,Option 2
Philippine Terrestrial Biodiversity,"As a student, what simple action can you take to help protect biodiversity in your local area?", Collecting wild plants and animals to keep at home.,Supporting campaigns that protect endangered species.,Building roads through protected forests for easier access.,Introducing foreign plants to local ecosystems.,Option 2
Tree of Life,Phylogenetic trees are used to show the relationships among species. What do the branches of the tree represent?,Different environments where species live,Evolutionary paths and common ancestors, Levels of biodiversity in a region,The physical sizes of organisms,Option 2
Tree of Life,"The tree of life divides all organisms into three main domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. If you discovered a new organism living in a hot spring, which domain would it most likely belong to?",Eukarya,Bacteria,Archaea,Protists,Option 3
Tree of Life,"Charles Darwin and other scientists used the concept of a ""tree"" to show how species are related. What type of evidence do scientists today often use to build these trees?",Fossils and rock samples,Genetic information like RNA or DNA sequences,The size and color of organisms,The location of organisms on the planet,Option 2
Tree of Life,"Unlike eukaryotes, prokaryotes like bacteria can exchange genes between different species. How might this affect the way scientists create phylogenetic trees for bacteria?",It makes it easier to classify bacteria into neat categories.,It complicates the tree since gene transfer creates new traits not inherited from parent organisms., It shows that all bacteria come from one single ancestor.,It means bacteria are not related to any other forms of life.,Option 2
Tree of Life, Why do you think it is important for scientists to study the evolutionary relationships between different organisms?,To identify which animals are the fastest runners.,To understand how different species evolved and adapted over time.,To create lists of animals that are most popular as pets.,To find which plants are the tallest in a forest.,Option 2
Payatas Dumpsite,The Payatas Dumpsite has transformed from an open dumpsite to a managed facility. Why do you think controlling waste disposal is important for communities?,It helps improve the appearance of neighborhoods only.,It reduces health risks and environmental damage., It prevents animals from entering the area., It increases the land available for housing.,Option 2
